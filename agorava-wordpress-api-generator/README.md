agorava-stackoverflow-api-generator
===================================

Inspired by previous work on agorava-stackexchange, this module allows download and generation of code from the URIs described in http://developer.wordpress.com/docs/api/

There are however some differences :

* a valid user token must be obtained from Wordpress (as described here http://developer.wordpress.com/docs/oauth2/ and testable using this example https://public-api.wordpress.com/rest/v1/me/?pretty=1)
